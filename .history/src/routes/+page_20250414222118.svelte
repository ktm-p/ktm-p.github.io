<p>I'm Michael, a Junior at UC Berkeley. I am majoring in Pure Mathematics and Computer Science, and minoring in Data Science. I am part of Berkeley's UPE chapter. You can check out my resume <a href="/resume/default/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
    
<br><br>

My interests revolve mainly around Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, and Cryptography for Computer Science. In Mathematics, I focus primarily on Algebra and Logic.

In my free time, I <a href="https://musescore.com/user/32734170" target="_blank">transcribe songs</a> that are stuck in my head. I also have an (unhealthy) obsession with using LaTeX, constantly adding to <a href="https://github.com/ktm-p/LaTeX-Setup" target="_blank">setup.</a></p>
