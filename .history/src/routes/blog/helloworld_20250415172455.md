After a lot of procrastinating, I finally refactored my website code... and also added a blog section! Which is all in markdown!

Now featuring some cool features like:
- Code blocks (with highlighting too -- wow!)
```python
print("This is a code block!")
```

- $\LaTeX$ as well. Oh, and we can do math environments as well:
$$
\begin{align}
    \int_{0}^\pi f(x) \mathrm{dx} &= \sin(\pi) - \sin(0) \\
    &= 0
\end{align}
$$

- Lists... like this one we're in.

Yeah, that's about it for now. I'll probably be adding more to this blog page with my musings, ramblings, and whatever else pops up in my mind. Oh, and I'll eventually add in a button to switch to light mode (ew).
