After a lot of procrastinating, I finally refactored my website code... and also added a blog section! Now, featuring some cool features like code blocks (with highlighting too -- wow!):
```python
print("This is a code block!")
```

And, of course, a bit of $\LaTeX$ as well. Oh, and we can do math environments as well:
$$
\begin{align}
    \int_{0}^1 f(x) \mathrm{dx} &= \frac{1}{x} \right\|_0^1 \\
    &= ???
\end{align}
$$
