After a lot of procrastinating, I finally refactored my website code... and also added a blog section! Which is all in markdown!

Now featuring some cool features like:
- Code blocks (with highlighting, too -- wow!)
```python
print("This is a code block!")
```

- $\LaTeX$, so I can do all of my funky $\sum_{i=1}^n \varphi(i)$ stuff.

- This also includes different maths environments, like my beloved `align`:
$$
\begin{align}
    \int_{0}^\pi f(x) \mathrm{dx} &= \sin(\pi) - \sin(0) \\
    &= 0
\end{align}
$$

- And lists. I mean, this isn't as exciting...

But yeah, that's about it for now. I'll probably be adding more to this blog page (unless I forget about its existence). Topics will most likely range from my incoherent ramblings to musings about some hopefully-interesting topics to walkthroughs of any project I may decide to make.

I'll also be adding more functionality to the website eventually. Some of it will be simple refactoring of the code, some will be features (like being able to switch to light mode... ew). We'll see how it turns out.
