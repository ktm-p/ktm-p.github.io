                This is an Audio Analyzer program I wrote using Processing. It features the ability for the user to play a desired mp3 audio file and see graphical representations of certain information on the file. This includes the Audio Waveform and its Polar Graph representation, the Discrete Fourier Transform of the audio, the audio's level, and also its beat.

                For the project, I coded a real Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm, along with creating all of the graphs. The beat detection was implemented by comparing the current audio's level to previous ones and, if the difference is marginal, a beat is detected.
