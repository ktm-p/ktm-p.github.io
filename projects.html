                        <p>Pytris is a Tetris clone implemented in Python, made using the pygame library. The user is able to move and rotate the tetrominoes following the standard Tetris Super Rotation System. Users are also able to hold blocks. A block silhouette feature is implemented as well, along with a preview of the next couple of blocks.

                        The project features an understanding of object-oriented programming in order to implement multiple classes (for the game, board, tetrominoes, etc.). Additionally, a grasp on the pygame library is required in order to implement the gameplay loop and user actions.

                        <p>In this project, I wrote an interpreter for Scheme which translate code written in the language into Python, then displaying the output. The interpreter can parse primitives and user-defined procedures, and special forms.

                        The project relies on an understanding of object-oriented programming and recursion in order to parse the Scheme expressions with custom Python objects, analyze the provided input, evaluate it, and then return an output. Tail-recursion was also implemented for specific methods in order to optimize memory usage.

                        The CPU is capable of performing an assortment of instructions, such as I-type and R-type instructions, branch comparisons, loads and stores, and also jump instructions. The project also features pipelining as well for instruction-level parallelism.

                        <p>This project is focused on optimizations to better the runtime of a naive implementation of the 2D Convolution Algorithm.
                        <br><br>
                        In order to optimize the base algorithm, I applied different techniques such as working with pointers directly via pointer arithmetics, reorganizing the order in which the steps were executed to optimize cache usage, and using registers for commonly-used variables.
                        <br><br>
                        The project also used OpenMP to introduce parallel programming, significantly reducing the runtime even more. Also, by using SIMD instructions to vectorize operations, along with loop unrolling, the runtime was further reduced. Overall, the optimizations led to approximately a x50 speedup.

                        <p>In this project, I designed a secure file sharing system which used cryptographic library functions, and then implemented it in Golang.
                        <br><br>
                        As part of the design process, I had to figure out how to implement the sharing system. Then, I had to determine possible vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit to execute malicious actions. Furthermore, I had to ensure that my code had the functionalities required of a file sharing system. This was accomplished through over three thousand lines of testing code, including fuzz testing as well to handle possible edge cases I may have missed.
                        <br><br>                        
                        In order to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of user data, I used symmetric encryption, HMACs, and digital signatures.

                        <p>Over the course of this project, I learned to use PyTorch on a variety of machine learning problems, ranging from approximating a sinusoidal curve to digit recognition and language detection.
                        <br><br>
                        For recognizing digits, I initially implemented a two-layer Linear Neural Network with a ReLU activation function and Cross-Entropy loss. Later on, I implemented a Convolutional Layer as well to take into account things such as spatial features of the image, and then flattened it down. Ultimately, my model achieved an accuracy of over 98%.

                        <p>In this project, I trained Pac-Man using Reinforcement Learning so that he can win. In order to do this, I implemented value iteration, Q-Learning, Approximate Q-Learning, and Deep Q-Learning with PyTorch. I also coded up the Epsilon-Greedy action selection for Pac-Man's policy.
                        <br><br>
                        For Deep Q-Learning, I implemented it using a five-layer Linear Neural Network which uses the ReLU activation function and Mean Square Error loss. Through this, I achieved over an approximately 90% winrate with my Pac-Man agent.
                        <br><br>
                        Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of PyTorch, along with how to finetune hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch and hidden layer sizes, and the number of training episodes.

                        For the project, I had to clean up the dataset and filter out all of the noisy data, analyze the relationship between possible features and their class in order to determine the features to be used, and also extract key information from emails.
