                After creating the Audio Analyzer and familiarizing myself with Processing, I decided to create my own Audio Visualizer. The project features usage of the Fast Fourier Transform to convert the audio into frequency-domain information, along with implementing a 3D Terrain generation system with Perlin Noise.

                Using FFT, I created graphics that were responsive to the audio being played: on the top of the screen are lines that represent the amplitudes of certain frequencies. Furthermore, 3D objects were rendered and the speed at which it moved and rotated depends on the frequencies playing. Additionally, a polar graph is constructed whose edges fluctuates depending on the audio. Finally, at the bottom of the screen is a 3D Terrain made using Perlin Noise. The speed at which the user traverses the terrain is influenced by the audio as well.
